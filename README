NAME
    Digest::Perl::MD4 - Perl implementation of Ron Rivests MD4
    Algorithm

DISCLAIMER
    This is not C-code interface (like `Digest::MD5') but a Perl-only
    implementation of MD4 (like `Digest::Perl::MD5'). Because of this, it is
    slow but avoids platform specific complications. For efficiency you
    should use `Digest::MD4' instead of this module if it is available.

SYNOPSIS
     # Functional style
     use Digest::Perl::MD4 qw(md4 md4_hex md4_base64);

     $hash = md4 $data;
     $hash = md4_hex $data;
     $hash = md4_base64 $data;

     # OO style
     use Digest::Perl::MD4;

     $ctx = Digest::Perl::MD4->new;

     $ctx->add($data);
     $ctx->addfile(*FILE);

     $digest = $ctx->digest;
     $digest = $ctx->hexdigest;
     $digest = $ctx->b64digest;

MANIFEST

README		This file.
MD4.pm		The Perl code implementing Rivest's MD4 algorithm.
Digest-MD4.pm	A wrapper module called Digest::MD4.
test.pl		A test program for the MD4 module.

The MD4 module's interface should be compatible with the C-code MD4
module written by Mike McCauley <mikem@open.com.au>.  The Digest-MD4.pm
is provided which makes the MD4 module available as the shorter module
Digest::MD4.  It should *not* be installed as is if Mike's module is
already installed.  If you want both of these installed (e.g. multiple
platforms are using the same installation), the adaptive aspects of
Digest-MD4.pm will have to be merged with the Mike's actual MD4.pm code.

Assuming "Perl-site-lib" is one of the directories listed in @INC,
install the module like this:

file		Perl-site-lib
----		------------------
MD4.pm		Digest/Perl/MD4.pm
Digest-MD4.pm	Digest/MD4.pm		# if C-code MD4 is NOT installed
